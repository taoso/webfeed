            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>« Everything started from an unused piece of land. We asked the city if it was possible to grow food there for a local festival. The city agreed and sent 30 trucks full of soil to spread on the abandoned area. It was a huge work to set up these gardens, but now there are about 60 patches which can be distributed to anyone who wants to garden. »</blockquote><p>This is how Martin Abelmann and green citizens of the city of Stuttgart in Germany created the project Stadtacker. Their goal is to give small pieces of land to city dwellers who want to grow veggies and fruits by themselves.</p><p>They are not the <a href="https://medium.com/environmental-intelligence/fish-and-veggies-directly-from-your-garden-geco-gardens-aquaponic-3645721f150c">only one</a> who want to grow food in the city. As <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/urbanization/the_worlds_cities_in_2016_data_booklet.pdf">more than 50 %</a> of the world population is living in urban settlements, many projects worldwide are flourishing to bring food closer to people. This trend is called urban gardening.</p><p>Urban gardening is not only about growing food to feed the near 8 billion earthlings, it’s also about creating a healthy environment, improving people knowledge about Nature and building a sympathetic community.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*s8Gqm3dmzDaYJXkotarQQg.jpeg" /><figcaption>On an Abandoned Land © <a href="https://www.stadtacker.de/galerie/">stadtacker</a></figcaption></figure><p>The space humanity needs on Earth is increasing so cities are becoming a new home for insects, birds and small mammals. Organic gardens are a biodiversity friendly habitat as fruits and veggies are greatly appreciated by wildlife. Moreover the countryside is saturated by dangerous agricultural pollutants and doesn’t supply enough resources anymore, therefore cities may be a good refugee for biodiversity like <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2015/bees-110215">bees and pollinators</a>.</p><p>There are many benefits of gardening in the cities. They improve people life with small services such as air filtering, temperature cooling and CO2 absorption. Thus, they reduce greenhouse gas emissions by shortening the supply chain; food doesn’t travel thousand of kilometers anymore, instead it is produced locally and eaten directly by the gardeners.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5aPL8lqjzAOysPIU326W6w.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CE0L7IjxAxL9Rkj6mnL3_g.jpeg" /><figcaption>Whoever Can Grow Their Food © <a href="https://www.stadtacker.de/galerie/">stadtacker</a></figcaption></figure><p>Did you know that carrots grow in the ground and not on trees ? I hope yes, but imagine young children who were born in a city and never had the chance to go farming in the countryside. I guess, nowadays they are many who don’t know at which time of the year strawberries are grown or on which tree zucchinis are grown. Urban gardening is an opportunity for these children to learn about the food they eat. Even adults may not know how to seed and then thin carrots. Urban gardening makes people aware about the resource and labor needed to grow food. City dwellers are running further and further away from Nature and they are sadly forgetting the basics : food.</p><blockquote>« During the sunny season, we meet weekly every Sunday afternoon. We talk, we ask advice about how to grow this and that. We make friends. Sometimes in the summer, we organize events like music concert, workshops etc. »</blockquote><p>As Martin Abelmann highlighted, a community garden is a meeting point. Neighbors meet, talk and have fun. They exchange their know-hows and recipes, the garden becomes a school, a school of Nature, a school of Life.</p><p>The green area also encourages the new formed community to participate in the city development and planning. It becomes a place to create planning alternatives, a place to defend environmental ideas, a place to strengthen democracy.</p><blockquote>“The gardening area is threatened by a housing building project and even if our garden got a city award and a United Nation price for the decade of the biodiversity, we still need people to militate. We need to show that such a green place managed by citizens has a higher value than building houses. Through public awareness, we hope to be able to keep this green area and continue to grow an environmentally friendly community. “ Martin Abelmann</blockquote><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e9610374b19c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/invironment/picking-fruits-and-greening-cities-e9610374b19c">Picking Fruits and Greening Cities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/invironment">Invironment</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2SoTLIZNKFtO3OMV95zHww.jpeg" /><figcaption>The Mad Forager’s Kitchen</figcaption></figure><h4>How to Infuse Oils and Vinegars with Foraged Ingredients</h4><p><em>Previously available only to Medium members, we are now pleased to offer this article for free to everyone.</em></p><p>Fallen leaves and chilly temperatures don’t mean you have to stop harvesting wild ingredients until Spring. No matter where you are or how cold (or warm) it is outside, there are always ample opportunities to experiment with new tastes, provided you know how to think about flavor. One of the nicest ways to experience wild flavor, and to prepare tasty foods using limited ingredients, is by infusing oils and vinegars.</p><p>When tasting wine, one is instructed to pay very close attention to flavors you might otherwise miss. Creating oils and vinegars with wild ingredients requires the same kind of discipline. We so rarely take the time to <em>notice</em> flavor, either because we’re eating on the go or because we’ve become so used to the Western flavor palette that, with a few exceptions, the tastes no longer surprise us. Creating new flavors with wild, foraged ingredients allows us to once again experience surprise. <em>This actually tastes like </em><strong><em>this</em></strong><em>?</em></p><p><strong>Everything has a flavor. </strong>Don’t be afraid to use ingredients like dead leaves, strips of bark, catkins, grasses, and seeds. Experimentation is key: keep a journal, and label your jars.</p><p>Consider the creation of wild infusions as similar as to that of perfume. Each ingredient has its own flavor profile. Is it sweet? Bitter? Tannic? Green? Mushroomy? Stack flavors in themes, so that two or three tastes complement one another. Perhaps your oil has a major heavy or tannic note; if so, play with sharper flavors like conifer or fir. Balance floral or fruity flavors with dusky fall leaves, or mild grasses.</p><p>Your base will always contribute flavor and qualities, which is well worth keeping in mind. Olive oil and coconut oil are wonderful, but their inherent flavors can mask the subtleties of wild ingredients. Apple cider vinegar is one of the best for infusion, but it does sweeten and flavor on its own. High quality unflavored vinegar is worth seeking out if you wish to create vinegar infusions that carry their own essence.</p><blockquote>INFUSED VINEGARS</blockquote><p>Infused vinegars can add a splash of flavor to salads, sauces, or sautés. They are also delicious when added to drinks; try a dollop in soda water for a refreshing treat.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>:</p><ul><li>Prepare your wild ingredients. Clean, then chop as finely as possible. If dried, pulverize to a coarse powder using a coffee grinder or blender. If fresh, use a sharp knife or food processor.</li><li>In a glass canning jar, add your wild ingredient. If dried, fill no more than three-quarters, as the dried material will expand. If fresh, fill to an inch or two below the rim of the jar.</li></ul><p><strong>INFUSION METHODS:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cold infusion</strong>: fill with vinegar, cover the mouth of the jar with wax paper to avoid corroding the metal lid, and set the jar in a dark location for 10–14 days. Shake daily.</li><li>Hot infusion (use this method if you have bark or woody items in your blend): bring your vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan, then fill jar with boiling liquid. When cool enough to cover, cover the mouth of the jar with wax paper, seal, and set the jar in a dark location for 10–14 days.</li><li>When infusion is complete, strain the vinegar using a cheesecloth lined potato ricer, or a wooden spoon/mesh strainer.</li><li>Refrigerate, or store in a cool, dark, place.</li></ul><p><strong>PACIFIC NORTHWEST INFUSED VINEGAR RECIPES:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Forest Tree Vinegar #1</strong></li></ol><ul><li>Big Leaf Maple (<em>Acer macrophyllum): </em>2 browned leaves with stems</li><li>Hazelnut (<em>Corylus cornuta</em>): 5 leaves (or so), dried</li><li>Hazelnut: 10 catkin/cones, dried</li><li>Hazelnut: 10 very small twigs, 1–2”</li><li>Western Red Cedar (<em>Thuja plicata)</em>: Needles, fresh and chopped finely, ¼ cup</li><li>Add vinegar to fill 1 pint jar</li></ul><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Conifer Vinegar</strong></p><ul><li>Mix of needles, cones, etc. from Western Red Cedar, Douglas Fir, Western Hemlock, Grand fir, Pine, etc.</li><li><strong>Hot infusion works best.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Arbutus/Pine Vinegar</strong></p><ul><li>Strawberry tree (<em>Arbutus unedo)</em>: fruit, enough to fill ½ jar</li><li>Pine (<em>Pinus spp.): </em>Needles, 1 c. chopped</li><li>Pine: 3 small cones</li><li>Madrone (<em>Arbutus menziesii)</em>: bark, 2 palm-sized strips</li><li>Add vinegar to fill 1 pint jar</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/847/1*klzSDgoxryYUQw5_6gDiUg.jpeg" /></figure><blockquote>INFUSED OILS</blockquote><p>Infused oils are incredibly versatile; they can be used for everything from sautéing to dipping breads and crackers to adding flavor to cheeses or dressings.</p><p>Wild infused oils are particularly nice with lightly flavored foods: tofu, white fish, cheeses, chicken, etc.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p><ul><li>Prepare your wild ingredients. Clean, then chop as finely as possible. If dried, pulverize to a coarse powder using a coffee grinder or blender. If fresh, use a sharp knife or food processor.</li><li>In a glass canning jar, add your wild ingredient. If dried, fill no more than three-quarters, as the dried material will expand. If fresh, fill to an inch or two below the rim of the jar.</li><li>Fill with your chosen oil. Olive oil is great, but does add flavor. I prefer grapeseed or sunflower, as they are relatively inexpensive and don’t have much flavor on their own. After initially adding the oil, use a chopstick to stir and allow the oil to settle. You may end up needing to add additional oil.</li></ul><p><strong>INFUSION METHODS:</strong></p><ul><li>Slow infusion: set the jar in a warm location (i.e. in the sun, on a radiator, or a gas oven near the pilot light) for 10–14 days. Shake daily.</li><li>Quick infusion: Place your jar in a saucepan, and add enough water that it comes up about three quarters of the way up the side of the jar. Turn the water to medium/medium high until it just starts bubbling (it should be between 100–150 degrees but no more). Leave at this temperature in the water bath for approximately an hour. At this point, you can remove and either strain for use or allow to infuse on top of the refrigerator for another 2 weeks or so.</li><li>When infusion is complete, strain the oil using a cheesecloth/potato masher, or a wooden spoon/mesh strainer. Allow to sit for 12 hours or so; if any water separates from the oil, you’ll need to remove by pouring off the oil or using a gravy separator in order to avoid potential storage.</li><li>Store in a cool, dark, place.</li></ul><p><strong>PACIFIC NORTHWEST INFUSED OIL RECIPES</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>“Seattle Parks and Rec” Oil</strong></p><p>I found all of the ingredients in this oil in a local park. These ingredients should be available from late September — early November.</p><ul><li>Big Leaf Maple (<em>Acer macrophyllum): </em>3 browned leaves</li><li>Sow thistle (<em>Sonchus arvensis)</em>: 7 green leaves (can substitute dandelion in a pinch, but these are sweeter)</li><li>Queen Anne’s Lace (<em>Daucus carota)</em>: 3 flower heads, fresh or dried</li><li>Clover (<em>Trifolium spp.)</em>: 15 Flowers, entire</li><li>Salal (<em>Gaultheria shallon</em>): 2 tbsp berries, dried</li><li>Cover with grapeseed oil to 8 oz.</li></ul><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Forest Tree Blend</strong></p><p>These ingredients can be found year-round, with the possible exception of the Turkey Tail Mushrooms (<em>Trametes versicolor)</em>, which can be dried when harvested or purchased from a reputable supplier.</p><ul><li>English Holly (<em>Ilex aquifolium)</em>: Ten leaves, completely dried until no longer glossy, roasted at 250 degrees for 30 minutes, and ground to a powder</li><li>Turkey Tail mushrooms (<em>Trametes versicolor</em>): Five coin-sized pieces, dehydrated</li><li>Madrone tree (<em>Arbutus menziesii</em>): Strips of outer bark (approx. 1/4 cup)</li><li>Alder tree (<em>Alnus rubra</em>): Hand-sized portion of outer bark, smoked, dried until brittle, and powdered</li></ul><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Large Leaf Avens Oil</strong></p><p>A wonderful base oil. The Large Leaf Avens (<em>Geum macrophyllum)</em> can be identified in fall/winter by the persistent dried flower-heads, which resemble large burrs. This plant’s roots have a distinct clove-like flavor.</p><ul><li>Infuse grapeseed oil with fresh roots and leaves (primarily roots) using Quick Infusion method above.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/447/1*jaNR2k8j-AVf1dy8GF4z2A.jpeg" /><figcaption><strong><em>Large Leaf Avens</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>As a final caveat, always research your wild ingredients thoroughly and carefully.<strong><em> If you’re not 100% sure what something is, don’t put it in your mouth.</em></strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=80e0fcbaf18d" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/invironment/wild-flavors-all-year-round-80e0fcbaf18d">Wild Flavors All Year Round</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/invironment">Invironment</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Many plants are deemed to be a substitute for more familiar grocery-store-bought fare. Lamb’s quarter carries with it the distinction of being arguably <em>superior</em> to that which it substitutes: spinach. It has a fantastic pillowy texture when steamed, and a flavor that is every bit as satisfying. It is peculiar for a plant to be so delicious, yet, have relatively few mentions in ancient/archaic literature. Perhaps it is time for us to sing the praises of <em>C. album</em> in our own times.</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Growing from one to six feet tall, this cosmopolitan weed has alternate leaves that can be wavy to lobate and are dusted with waxy granular crystals; the flowers are inconspicuous and occur at leaf axils and at the end of stems [2]. The undersides of the leaves are often colored with purple when young, and become lighter in color than the top of the leaf when matures. The leaf shape reminds many of a goose’s foot. The plant is odorless.</p><h3>Habitat</h3><p>A common garden weed, Lamb’s quarter is found in any area with moisture and disturbed soil including cultivated fields [2].</p><h3>Culinary Uses</h3><p>When the lamb’s quarter is young, it is prepared and used in the exact same way one would prepare spinach. The young flower buds are also edible. Seeds can be sprouted, and are said to be edible when saponins are leached from the grain [6].</p><h3>Folk Remedies</h3><p>The Inupiat peoples cooked this plant with beans to reduce flatulence; the Navajo and Kayenta peoples used <em>C. album</em> as a poultice to be applied to burns; the Powawatomi peoples ate lamb’s quarter to ward away scurvy; the Cree and Woodlands people used this plant in a wash for aching limbs [3]. This is one of the few herbs I have found mentioned as a traditional treatment for peptic ulcers [11].</p><h3>Pharmaceutical effects</h3><p><em>Chenopodium album</em> has shown promise as a safe spermicidal contraceptive in studies on rabbits [5]. C. album also has proven to be a plant of possible commercial importance to produce natural health products due to the high occurrence of phenolic compounds in the plant; these compounds have shown to be useful as free radical scavenging, anti-cancer, metal chelating, and treatment agents for atherosclerosis [8].</p><h3>Magic</h3><p>The Navajo and Ramah peoples fashioned this plant into the shape of a snake as an antidote to snake bites [3].</p><h3>History</h3><p>Evidence of the use of <em>C. album</em> has been found in the culture of Lake Village (Switzerland) which suggests to anthropologists that the use of this plant may go back millennia [5]. Lamb’s quarter was mentioned by the Lewis and Clark expedition as a plant that was widely thought to have been introduced post white settlement [10]. As medicine and food, C. album has been of particular interest to the people of India having been mentioned in numerous Vedic texts in ancient Sanskrit [11].</p><h3>Literature</h3><blockquote>“In all localities which are affected by the failure of <br>crops, all — the well-to-do and the poor families alike — <br>eat poor bread which is made with orache.” — Leo Tolstoy</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Gsovr1pUPuAUDcB07JqoGw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Image attribution: Creative commons. Retrieved from <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Leo_Tolstoy_portrait.jpeg">here</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Nutrition</p><p>This plant is high in antioxidants and has antibacterial properties [11]. It is an excellent source of magnesium and potassium (beating out spinach, Swiss chard, and broccoli), lutein, and carotenoids [12].</p><h3>Recipes</h3><h4>Lamb’s-Quarter Gazpacho [7].</h4><p>1/2 pound lobster tail or daw meat, cooked,(*) or 4 large shrimp, unpeeled</p><p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p><p>A few sprigs fresh thyme</p><p>Cracked fresh pepper</p><p>Salt to taste</p><p>7 ounces lamb’s-quarter or young spinach leaves</p><p>5 1/4 ounces ice</p><p>1/2 ounce white bread,</p><p>firmly textured, soaked in water</p><p>2 tablespoons grapeseed oil,</p><p>available at specialty-food shops</p><h4>Procedure</h4><ul><li>1. If using shrimp, marinate shrimp in olive oil, thyme, pepper and salt for 5 minutes. Grill until cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li><li>2. In a saucepan of boiling salted water blanch the lamb’s-quarter or spinach for 10 seconds, drain and refresh in cold water. Drain.</li><li>3. In a blender combine the lamb’s-quarter, ice, bread, and grapeseed oil and pulse until smooth. Correct seasoning.</li><li>4. Divide gazpacho evenly among small bowls and garnish each with lobster meat or one shrimp. Yield: 4 servings (*) The meat from a 1-pound lobster should yield enough to garnish 4 servings.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><p>C. album has been studied as an agent of phytoremediation for the cleanup of soils contaminated with chromium [9]. This is a source of concern because the plant was shown to be able to take up enormous amounts of the element. As always, harvest in areas that are not known to be contaminated with pollution.</p><h3>Poisonous Lookalikes</h3><p>SEE:<em> Solanum physalifolium</em>, <em>Solanum sarracoides</em>, <em>Solanum villosum</em></p><h3>For other stories about unusual and/or wild plants and mushrooms, please visit <a href="https://www.pullupyourplants.com/unusual-garden-plants/">www.pullupyourplants.com</a></h3><p>By K.D. Healey</p><p>Thanks for your support!</p><h3>References</h3><ol><li>Borror, D.
