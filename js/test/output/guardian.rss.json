      "summary": "<p>Even Donald Trump’s more extreme supporters did not seem to mind that he sounded almost like a traditional Republican</p><p>Those expecting that Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address would be remarkable, for better or worse, were disappointed last night. It was mostly a rehearsal of by-now familiar Trumpian talking points, and some disingenuous “reaching out” on immigration policy, all delivered with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/typical-but-forgettable-trump-took-on-a-new-role-during-state-of-the-union\">workmanlike oratorial competence</a>. For the president, of course, it was yet another opportunity for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2018/jan/30/the-kind-of-night-donald-trump-loves-best-when-he-can-applaud-himself\">grandstanding</a>. </p><p>An unexpectedly normal speech meshed well with a new imperative among conservatives to normalize the speaker. In 2018, Trump’s campaign rhetoric around economic populism has come to nothing. His talk on immigration – still punitive and restrictionist – hews much closer to the GOP’s standard line. The populist-nationalist interlopers have been flushed out of the White House. All this means that more traditional Republican conservatives have less to object to. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/so-how-did-conservatives-like-the-state-of-the-union\">Continue reading...</a>",
